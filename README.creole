== Usage
Here is a bunch of sample commands :
* ./TimeSheet.py file.csv after 2009-10-04
* ./TimeSheet.py file.csv after 1998-03
* ./TimeSheet.py file.csv before 2022-02-22
* ./TimeSheet.py file.csv between 2000 2001-06

It's helpful to know that dates are stored as plain text. So the format isn't modifiable but it allows easy and 
quick partial dates usage (including me :).
